# Network Engineering Lab

This project is a hands-on simulation of real-world network engineering tasks, built to showcase skills in **network design, configuration, monitoring, and automation**.  
It covers both theoretical documentation and practical implementations using industry-standard tools and configurations.

## Contents
- [1. Network Design](./docs/network-design.md)
- [2. Network Device Configuration](./configs/)
- [3. Network Security](./security/)
- [4. Monitoring & Troubleshooting](./monitoring/)
- [5. Automation with Python & PowerShell](./automation/)
- [6. Documentation](./docs/)

---

## Tools & Technologies
- Cisco IOS-like configurations (Switches, Routers, Firewalls)
- Packet Tracer / GNS3 for simulation
- Python (Netmiko, Paramiko) for automation
- PowerShell for Windows network management
- Wireshark for traffic analysis
- Network protocols: TCP/IP, DNS, DHCP, VPN, ACLs

---

## Objectives
- ✅ Install & configure network hardware/software (simulated configs)  
- ✅ Monitor & troubleshoot network performance  
- ✅ Implement security (firewalls, ACLs, VPNs)  
- ✅ Document procedures and configs  
- ✅ Automate repetitive network tasks  

---

## How to Use
1. Review the **network design** in [docs/network-design.md](./docs/network-design.md).
2. Load the configs from [configs/](./configs/) into Packet Tracer or GNS3.
3. Test monitoring and troubleshooting using [monitoring/](./monitoring/).
4. Run automation scripts from [automation/](./automation/).
